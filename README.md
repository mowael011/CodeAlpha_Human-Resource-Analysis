# 📊 Human Resources (HR) Analytics Dashboard


## ✨ Report Overview & Key Tabs

The interactive dashboard is structured into two main, high-impact pages:

### 1. 📈 HR Core Metrics & Workforce Overview

This tab focuses on the current state and efficiency of the workforce, featuring KPIs across:

* **Headcount & Structure:** Total employee count, distribution by **Department**, **Location**, and **Tenure**.
* **Demographics:** Detailed visualizations of the workforce by **Age Group** and **Gender**.
* **Recruitment Funnel:** Analysis of hiring efficiency, including **Time to Hire** and **Cost Per Hire**.

### 2. 📉 Attrition, Retention & Cohort Analysis

This tab is dedicated to answering the critical question of why employees leave and how to improve retention:

* **Key Attrition Rate:** Overall monthly and yearly turnover rates.
* **Turnover Drivers:** Breakdown of attrition by **Voluntary vs. Involuntary** status, and segmented analysis by high-risk groups (e.g., employees with less than 1 year of service).
* **Cohort Retention Diagram:** A powerful visual tracing the retention percentage of each hiring group (**cohort**) over time, pinpointing months or periods with poor long-term retention performance.
